Thank for spending your time here. Don't forget to check out my repositories. 👋

I believe I will always be a beginner in everything I aspire to do. And I'm happy about that. It means I am still young enough not to hesitate learning anything new. 😉
Hope you'll find something helpful or inspiring in my repositories. I'd love any invitation to collaborate with you. 🤝

## 🧑🏻‍🚀 Who am I?
- 🎓 I have a Master's degree in Business Intelligence and Smart Services, and a Bachelor's degree in International Business and Economics. Even when I was a child, I loved both natural and social science. Therefore, now I do not want to label myself, for a big label might restrict my space to grow. With the life goal of bettering the world, I can play management, technical, and commercial roles at the same time.
